## Workflows
Start easy, then get more complex, known as progressive disclosure of complexity. This means that you don't need to learn everything up front.

### Models
The Sequential API, which we have used, is on the far side of the spectrum, aimed at novice users. Sequential is basically a Python list, which limits it to simple stacks of layers, and a single input and output. The Functional API spans both standard use cases and niche uses, uses a graph-like model architecture. Functional also supports MIMO, and is the most commonly used framework. From there, subclassing is for researchers, who are writing everything from scratch.
