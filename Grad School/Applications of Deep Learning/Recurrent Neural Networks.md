## Time-series Data
Timeseries refers to any data that can be described as having a temporal component; weather data changes with time, as does financial data. 

## Recurrent Neural Network
Uses a *state* to maintain information relative to what it has seen before. Does this through the use of a recurrent relation from the output back into the RNN block.
