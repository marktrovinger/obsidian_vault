# Paper Overview
- they used a vision-based system to focus on the problem of grasping
- closed-loop system, as opposed to an open-loop
- may have used an offline RL dataset of 580k grasp attempts
- uses only the vision from an over-the-shoulder camera to performs different types of motion associated with grasping, such as repositioning, finding the most optimal grasp, and responds to being messed with
