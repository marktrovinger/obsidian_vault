## Definitions
- decentralization: each agent can perceive, communicate, and take actions on its own
- stochastic game: $(N, S, A, r, \tau)$ 
## Concepts
- Sequential and macro actions:
	- macro: when actions have varying durations
	- sequential: turn taking
- Imperfect information
	- Joint observation space $O = O_{0} \bigtimes \dots \bigtimes O_n$ 
	- May not satisfy the Markov property
	- May not be able to infer state from joint observational history $h = \{o_0, o_1, \dots o_t\}$
