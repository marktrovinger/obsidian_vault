### ViZDoom meeting
Meeting notes:
- look into the notification buffer that Marek is working on
- text instructions
- Python dictionary

### Robotics
Started a read through (and notes) of [[Deep RL Real World Survey Paper]], looking primarily for papers that can influence research into simulators, although that may not be enough.

### Robotics
There is some interesting work being done in the space of horizon reduction; the idea that part of the reason that RL algorithms don't work as well, especially Q-learning, is that the horizon is too long. I need to look into this more.

### Fundamental Practice in DRL
I have been thinking about what fundamental practice should look like for myself, a PhD student in DRL.

### Robotics
I have been reading papers about how the long time horizon in robotics tasks may be part of the reason that algorithms fail so badly.

### Fundamental Practice in DRL
Some ideas that have been percolating in my brain:
- Scales for musicians == algorithmic flashcards?

### Fundamental Practice in DRL
Some more ideas:
- Implementation of a particular algorithm from scratch, do this once a month?
- Write a short paragraph everyday detailing how a particular algorithm works
- Write the equations for each algorithm from memory, be able to explain what the terms mean

### Fundamental Practice in DRL
I think I have a pretty good idea of how I would structure a basic practice session:
1. Review terminology; on-policy, off-policy, value function, action value function, read the relevant chapters of RL book
2. Develop flashcards for terms reviewed that day, including equations
3. Re-read summaries of basic algorithms, write my own summaries

I think that each practice session should be roughly an hour in length, with each step taking about 20 minutes. I am going to schedule practice starting tomorrow.

### Robotics
Still reading through the [[Horizon Reduction Makes RL Scalable]] paper, I think there is a disconnect with how the RL community handles things like simulators compared to how the robotics community handles them.

### Fundamental Practice in DRL
Today starts my first practice session, I imagine that it will be an iterative process, with several versions. I think that similarly to the way practice works for instruments, and workouts differ day to day, that a similar approach would be useful. For the first day, I am going to spend 15 minutes working on flashcards for terminology, 15 minutes for reading about differing algorithms and 30 minutes writing summaries about the algorithms studied that day.
#### Algorithms
- DQN
- IQL
- PPO

### Robotics
Continuing reading [[Horizon Reduction Makes RL Scalable]], looking at the ways that RL researchers approach robotics tasks, compared with the way that robotics researchers approach those same tasks.

### Fundamental Practice
Most of the notes I have, are in a book, planning on adding these into here this week. Adding notes for Bandit algorithms today. Reading the Alon paper today, along with finding the Hemming (You and your research).

### Robotics/Horizon Reduction
Might be something interesting here, DT is not used in this work, maybe look into that?
