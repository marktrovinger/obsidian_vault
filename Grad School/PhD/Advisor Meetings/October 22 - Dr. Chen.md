## Working On
- Environment setup
	- Working on 20.04
	- Looking for 
- Environment dynamics
	- See sim2real paper

# Scope Clarification
- What do we want to be able to put into the paper?
	- Doable in 2 months, Final for AI Robotics, proof of concept, set up the environment, working RL algorithm in simulator
- What tasks do I need to complete in order to make sure that happens?
- We know the deadline, what should the timeline look like?
	- Paper writing before deadline, re-use sections from proposal and the interim report and final report
	- experiments done end of Nov, then start writing the paper after that
	- Meeting with robot operator Leonel sometime next month
 - Division of duties
	 - Do you want to be on the paper?
	 - Experiments go to one person, writing is one person's job
	 - Comparison of performance of different algorithms
## API and Gazebo
- State is fully observable
- Move end-effector to that position
- MoveIt! for low-level positioning
- Look into ROS2 Kortex, may work better than ROS1 Kortex on a wider range

# Goals
- Script that can do a pick and place for a piece and send to Teams group
- Can we do two arms in the simulator?
- ~~Make the robot arm in Gazebo, load the robot
