# Tasks Since Last Meeting
- Read a bunch of papers about offline RL
	- Biggest issue: OOD problem
	- Problem extends into robotics
- Dr. Chen Meeting
	- Talked about several areas, formulate a small project related to DT, use a simple robotics environment to start
- RL Algorithmic Analysis
	- Analyze tabular methods, $Q$-Learning, TD-learning, SARSA, Monte Carlo methods
# Papers of interest
- [[Offline RL - Survey]]
- [[CQL]]
- [[FisherBRC]]
- [[TD3+BC]]

# Potential Ideas
- continue working on developing a sense of what work has been, what approaches have worked, what work needs to be done
- start developing an idea for improvement or new algorithm that can be tied into work on DT

# Next
- presentation of work done, meet with lab mates next week
- Oct 2, 3:00 PM
- Denoising/reward poisoning papers
