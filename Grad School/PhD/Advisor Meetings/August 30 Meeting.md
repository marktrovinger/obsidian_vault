# What I have done
- Paper reading
- Grabbed more papers from from RLC 
	- An Open-Loop Baseline for Reinforcement Learning Locomotion Tasks

# Questions I have
- Algorithms class: would some subset of RL algos be a good candidate for term project
- Rate of paper reading? What is considered a "good" rate?

# Term Paper
- Survey of algorithmic efficiency

# Notes
- Current offline RL algorithms 
	- Conservative Q Learning
	- Run the code if it exists

# Before Next Meeting
- I need a better understanding of offline RL algorithms
	- Read relevant papers for offline, making sure to understand how the algorithms work moving forward
		- Read code that goes along with papers, understand the code!
- Start formulating a plan for future research, what ideas could be explored?
