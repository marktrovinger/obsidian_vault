# Potential Ideas
- DT acting as a planning module for BoT, which acts as the control system
- Useful link: https://github.com/opendilab/awesome-decision-transformer
- Conference: https://spie.org/conferences-and-exhibitions/defense-and-commercial-sensing/program/browse?term=&pageSize=50&pagesVisited=1&sortBy=Relevance&tab=Conference
	- Can submit abstract
	- There is conference $

# RL Algorithmic Analysis
- Analyze tabular methods, $Q$-Learning, TD-learning, SARSA, Monte Carlo methods
- i.e. not deep methods
	- Worth it, compare

# 6643
- make sure I submitted the correct video


# Going forward
- DT for robotics:
	- Work well in simulation, but sim2real is still a problem
	- Look into robots at PFW
	- Turtlebot 4
- Start small with DT!
	- Gym and MuJoCo
	- Gazebo

# Next Meeting
