### Potential Action Items
- Visual data from cameras to reduce sim2real gap? What simulators are capable of using camera data, since most are state-based?
	- Not used as much in manipulation tasks, as the envs in [[Towards Building AI-CPS with NVIDIA Isaac Sim - An Industrial Benchmark and Case Study for Robotics Manipulation]] used environments with state-based observations
	- Used quite a bit in ADS systems, look at CARLA, or if IsaacSim has ADS envs
- Value of robotic manipulators in game engines, such as UE5?
	- Investigate this!
- Workshop and other links:
	- https://sim2real.github.io/
	- http://sim2real.net/
	- Potential action item, longer term: a submission that performs well here would be a boon!
- Continue working on fundamental skills, read papers with an eye towards finding gaps, in either results or approaches
- Follow up papers from [[Quantifying the Reality Gap in Robotic Manipulation Tasks]], look at author's Google scholar and papers that reference it
- Find additional sim2real gap papers
- Work on fundamental skills with simulators! Expertise in IsaacSim might be valuable, look at which companies are using it and have open jobs!
- Relationship between DRL and compute speed? [[Horizon Reduction Makes RL Scalable]] mentions latency in robotics as an issue with non-Markovianness
