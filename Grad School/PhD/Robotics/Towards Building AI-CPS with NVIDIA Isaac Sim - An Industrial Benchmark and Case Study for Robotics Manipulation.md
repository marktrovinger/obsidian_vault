- 2023 paper
- Urgent need for benchmarks, especially for industrial robotics
- Cyber-physical system
- (speculation) The environments used are state based, not vision based
- Surveys of researchers that use simulators
- Falsification for defect detection
	- How effective is falsification?
- Comparison w/ other simulators
	- Sim2Real is roughly identical
	- Lack of pipeline for DRL tasks, which matches my experience from earlier this year, this may have changed though
- Robustness as an eval metric
- Large parallel experiments
