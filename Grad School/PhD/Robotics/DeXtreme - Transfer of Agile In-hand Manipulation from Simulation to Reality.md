- 2023 paper
- Code:
	- https://github.com/isaac-sim/IsaacGymEnvs/tree/main/isaacgymenvs/tasks/dextreme
- rl-games used, PPO
- vectorized automatic domain randomization
	- solving a Rubik's cube with Allegro Hand
- Vision based policy
	- Why are they used here, less so in other manipulation tasks?
- Fewer successes in real-world testing than in sim
- Well designed reward functions seems to be a big bottleneck for future, more complicated tasks
- Random seeds greatly impact performance, even when ADR suggests it shouldn't?
- Code is implemented as an IsaacGym task, will look at the migration guide to see if I can just use that for adding RL library to stack task
