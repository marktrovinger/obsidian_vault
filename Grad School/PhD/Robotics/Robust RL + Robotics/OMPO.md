### Possible Avenues of Research
- determining a proper local buffer size to capture the varying on-policy distribution
- relaxing the assumption of strictly positive rewards
- offline-to-online RL
- leveraging simulators with dynamics gaps to enhance policy learning
- hierarchical RL with non-stationarity in high-level policy optimization
