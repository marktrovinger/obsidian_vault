### General
- 2025 paper
- RL Benchmark for robust and safe RL and MARL

### Main Idea
- MDPs with disruption
	- obs: state and reward
	- action
	- env: changing some aspect of the simulation
- Multiple disruptors
- Benchmark several RL algorithms, robust RL and MARL algorithms
- Shifts in dynamics a useful exploration
