- 2021 paper
- 2 simulators
	- CoppeliaSim and Visual Components
- Focused on industrial robots
	- Seems to be a theme when talking about grasping/manip tasks
- Friction is big problem, as mentioned in [[Quantifying the Reality Gap in Robotic Manipulation Tasks]]
- Four physics systems were examined
	- PhysX by NVIDIA for VC
	- Bullet 2.78, Bullet 2.83, Vortex and ODE for CoppeliaSim
- Experiments:
	- Pick and Place: Cuboid and Sphere
	- Similar to [[Towards Building AI-CPS with NVIDIA Isaac Sim - An Industrial Benchmark and Case Study for Robotics Manipulation]]
- I need to look at RoboSuite
