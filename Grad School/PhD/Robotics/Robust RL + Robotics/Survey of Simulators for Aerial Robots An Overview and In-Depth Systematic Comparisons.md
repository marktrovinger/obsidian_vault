- Different simulators examined with different goals
- IsaacSim has an AerialSim, not sure if that is the same that is in IsaacLab or not
- Can AirSim do parallel simulations
- PyFlt for DRL focused approaches https://github.com/jjshoots/PyFlyt
- QuadSwarm may also be a possibility https://github.com/Zhehui-Huang/quad-swarm-rl
- May not be a valuable avenue of research at this time
