- 2022 paper
- Supports parallel training
- Also references Robosuite
- Multiple environments w/ various robots
- Creating custom envs:
	- GazeboEnv
	- RobotEnv
	- TaskEnv
	- Similar to PandaGym for structure
- Three prebuilt tasks for each robot type
- ODE of physics, mentions the use of domain randomization techniques using different physics engines, need to examine this!
- How many parallel envs can be created?
- How does this compare to [[Towards Building AI-CPS with NVIDIA Isaac Sim - An Industrial Benchmark and Case Study for Robotics Manipulation]]
