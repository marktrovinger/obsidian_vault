# Workstation
- Given that I don't want to mess up my ROS install on my desktop, it makes sense to use the workstation, but I need it to have screens, so I need to move it back under my desk
	- TODO (hardware):
		- Get the KVM and cables out of storage and find a place to put it on my desk
		- Setup the workstation under the desk, using the bracket from the desk
		- Set the screen resolution to 2560x1440 and see if that makes it more usable and less sluggish and check refresh rate 
	- TODO (software):
		- Remove ROS Iron or whatever I have installed
		- Install ROS Noetic 
		- Install ROS Kortex
		- Test simulator
