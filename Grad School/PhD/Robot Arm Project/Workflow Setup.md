## Docker 
- ~~idea: use a Docker dev container through VSCode to do development
- ~~get the `ros_gazebo_gym_ws` working with the Panda arm environment and build upon that, try to have that completed by meeting on Friday
- ~~idea: move the `kortex_gazebo` package into the `ros_gazebo_gym_ws` project

- need a list of the MoveIt! stuff that is present in kortex and how to use those in the env

## Env Creation
- ~~Template files used to start
