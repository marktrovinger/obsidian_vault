### Nov 25, 2025
I am starting this working log for the final project so I don't get behind on it. Work completed today:
- Messaged Dr. Luo about using Python, probably won't work, but I am going to try anyway
- Installed Robotics Toolbox for Python

#### Possible Project Ideas
I need to get a better sense of what exactly he is looking for when discussing
- VFH improvements, looking at existing work
- Use of DRL for path planning and implementation
- Adding step size annealing for OGM?

### Nov 26
I messaged Dr. Luo about my ideas for RL algorithms, haven't heard back yet. I did hear that I am allowed to use Python which will almost certainly cut down on the amount of time this project will take. If he gives me the go-ahead on RL, I can work on a list of realistic goals and a list of stretch goals (may need to do the stretch goals), and go from there.
Work completed:
- Messaged Dr. Luo re: RL
- Found a possible env in Minigrid
- Brainstorming on ideas

### Dec 1
I apparently didn't read the project description well enough; I have until Dec 9 to complete the project. Dr. Luo gave me the go-ahead to do an RL-based project, and I think I can finagle a project out of this that I actually want to do.
Work completed:
- Created an env for minigrid
- Got a test script working

### Dec 3
My goal for today is get the scripts written that will generate the plots needed for the project. I moved the `MiniGridFeaturesExtractor` class to `_utils.py` so I can use it more generally. I am testing PufferTank as well, both for training on this project, but also moving forward. 
TODO:
- Create python scripts for training, logging, etc.
- Create bash scripts for multiple envs.
