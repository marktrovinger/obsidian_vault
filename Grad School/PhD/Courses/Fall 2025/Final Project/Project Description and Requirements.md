## General
I am copying this from Canvas, as he doesn't have an actual project description up. I am also going to add notes as I work through this.

**Due date:** December 9, 2025, at 11:59 p.m.  
(I have two final exams, so please allow me a couple of days to grade your final projects.)

Your final project report and all associated files are due on the same date and time.
For **distance students**, please submit your work electronically on Canvas only.

The final project topic MUST be related to this class.  

Potential final project topics could include the following:
- D*-Lite combined with the Tangent Bug algorithm with moving obstacles
- Quadtree cell decomposition and local navigation
- Wavefront path planning and the Tangent Bug algorithm
- Improvements to the VFH method
- Occupancy Grid Map (OGM)–based path planning
- Other related topics......

Your project report should include the following sections (same as milestone project report).  
- Cover page
- Title page
- Table of Contents
- Introduction
- Description of the Project: This should include a textual explanation of the problem/design you are planning to do accompanied by your proposed solution, a block diagram, idea justification/ requirements, any algorithms, a main block diagram in case you are designing a component for an application.
- Explanation of your program modules, algorithms, suitability of your algorithms for applications.
- Discussion of any questions, concerns and results.
- Output any results.
- Design: Your main report should have the following appendices

- Your **original** C/Matlab code files with **detailed comments**
- A Readme file to explain your files
- A block diagram (or hierarchy) showing all your design algorithms (if applicable)
- Simulation results. The simulated results should be commented to highlight various events
- Observations, suggestions, explanations, discussion, possible extensions and comments
- List of references: papers, websites and other references

- **Readme File Requirement:**  
    A related manual explaining how to operate your code must be included in the appendix under **“Readme - How to Run the Source Code.”**
    I will run your source code for evaluation. *Submissions without a clear and complete Readme file will not receive credit.*
