- Used for localization
	- cartography and vision
- What are the sensors seeing? 
	- Based on position and measurement
- Models error by probability distribution
- Building a map -> mapping algorithms
- Need to maintain a map of the environment
- Mapping <- Position predict <- position update
- Odometry estimates position over time, relative to a starting location
	- Sensitive to errors
