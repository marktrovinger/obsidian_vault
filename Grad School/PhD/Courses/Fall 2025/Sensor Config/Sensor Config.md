### Components
- selection
- analysis 
- interface design
- integration
- testing
- considerations
	- signal connection
	- power
- Botzilla
	- vision based obstacles
	- Kalman filter
	- FPGA for fast sensor data processing
	- ROS 
	- Real time
- V-Module
	- concept -> requirements -> design -> implementation 
	- Then it goes back up
	- integration -> testing -> eval
- RS232 serial for communication
