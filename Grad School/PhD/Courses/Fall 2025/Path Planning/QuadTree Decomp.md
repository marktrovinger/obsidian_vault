- A form of [[Cell Decomp]]
- Split space into 4 recursively, testing for homogeneity
- Each internal node has four children
	- Empty
		- No obstacle
	- Mixed
		- Combination of free and obstacle
		- These nodes are expanded
	- Full
		- Just obstacle
- apply tree search algorithms to tree structure
- can be stored in an array, similar to binary tree
- decompose mixed cells until a sequence of free cells from start to goal is found
- creates a more reasonable trajectory
