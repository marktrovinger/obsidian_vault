- another form of [[Cell Decomp]]
- critical events
- planar sweep
- assumes a polygonal world
- Use graph search method to find the shortest path, $A^*$ or $D^*$ 
- C-space is the configuration space
- robot location is $W$
- $C_{free} = C | C_{obs}$ are free spaces
- $A = A(q)$ is the robot's location
