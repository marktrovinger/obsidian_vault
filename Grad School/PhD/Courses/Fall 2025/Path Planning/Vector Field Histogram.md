- improved versions are VFH+ and VFH*
- uses only recent sensor data
- probability of an obstacle in cell
- generates a polar histogram
- represented in a grid (2DOF)
- calculate steering direction
- cost function $G = a\cdot \verb|target_direction| + b\cdot \verb|wheel_orientation| + c \cdot \verb|previous_direction|$ 
- computationally efficient
- dimension reduction 3D->2D->1D
- creates a statistical representation of the environment
- components
	- cartesian histogram
	- polar histogram
	- candidate valley
- Be able to draw polar histogram from overhead shot of robot, find a protractor
- Path smoothing is important in rescue ops
- Bayes and other methods used to calc probability of occupancy
