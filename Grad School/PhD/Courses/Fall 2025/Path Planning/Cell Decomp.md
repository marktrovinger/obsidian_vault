- discrete cells, nodes and edges

### Method
- Goal: reduce search space into a number of cells
1) Divide into simple connected cells
2) Determine adjacency and create a graph
3) Search for path in graph between start and end
4) Compute a path within cell from a point on the boundary (or middle or centroid) to similar point on next cell
