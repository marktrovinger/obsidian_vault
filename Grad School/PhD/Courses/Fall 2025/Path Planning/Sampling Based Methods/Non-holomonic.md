- Holomonic is the kinematic restraints on a robot
- So, a holomonic robot has zero non-holomonic contraints
- So, a non-holomonic robot has at least one non-holomonic constraints
- A non-holomonic kinematic constraint requires a differential relationship, so a derivative of the position variable would be an example
- Non-integratable
