- Constructed incrementally, the idea is to connect disparate a new vertex to the existing connections
- Samples are sparsely sampled
- Two phases:
	- construction
		- a random config is created
		- Components:
			- Free space
			- Milestones (nodes)
			- local path
			- Start and goal
	- query
		- start and goal configs are connected
		- collision detection `GoodP.m` method in MATLAB
		- shortest path is found using Dijkstra's
		- Multi Query
			- Assumes multiple obstacles
	- May need to resample if no solution is found within some constraints
		- Uniform sampling
			- Create a graph, init with empty set for $V$ and $E$
- Doesn't compute the $C$-space explicitly, rather sample it
- Doesn't cross any obstacles
- Collision detection improvements lead to overall improvements
- PSPACE-hard problem for classic path planning
	- PSPACE can be solved in polynomial time
- Implementation
	- Main with sampling
	- Subroutines
		- Map
		- Random
		- Viz?
- Difficulties
	- Failure rate
		- $r(q) = \frac{no. failed LINK}{no. LINK}$ 
	- Weight
		- $w(q) = \frac{r(q)}{\sum_p r(p)}$ 
	- Resample probability
		- $Pr(q) = w(q)$
