## Approaches to $P\neq NP$
- Diagonalization
- Circuit Complexity
	- Can't use small AND, OR, NOT gates
- Proof complexity
## Interactive Proofs
- Can't get better approximations unless $P=NP$
- probabilistically checkable proof system
- Uniqe Games Conjecture
	- MAX-CUT

## Using Hardness
- We expect $P \neq NP$ to hold in strong ways
- Cryptography
	- if $P = NP$, public key crypto is impossible
- Eliminating Randomness

## Quantum Computers and NP-Complete
- Maybe, but the cost might make it prohibitive


## A New Hope?
- Geometric Complexity Theory
- Integer programming for a family $P_n$ is in $P$
	- Prove that LP relaxation solves the integer programming problem $P_n$ in polynomial time
		- Solving this would provide insights to $P$ vs $NP$
	- Find an efficient, simple combinatorial algo for the integer programming problem for $P_n$
		- No clear path to do this
	- Prove the simple algorithm always answers "yes"
		- Same for this problem

## Conclusion
- Doesn't end or start the story
	- edge cases for certain problems
	- No one truly understands $P$ versus $NP$
