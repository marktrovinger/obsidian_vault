## Overall Idea
- set of techniques to determine good lower-bound estimates for worst and average case
- Order Optimal Algos
	- Simple counting args
		- a certain amount of minimal work must be done in order to correctly output a solution
		- Eg. Comparison algorithm must do at least $n-1$ comparisons for a given input $n$
	- Enum args
		- more complicated than simple counting
		- id a combinatorial or numeric entity associated with inputs of $n$
		- the average complexity bounded below by the average number of combinatorial entities
	- Decision Trees
		- hierarchy of all possible branchings
		- determining the worst case involves determining the minimum depth of the tree
		- minimum leaf path is used for the average complexity
	- Adversary args
		- force an algorithm to perform basic operations in order to determine the lower bound
		- Eg, a guessing game
	- Information theoretic
		- compute the limitations of the amount of information that can be gained by a basic operation and showing how much more is needed to solve the problem
	- Graph theoretic
		- lower bounds for parallel algorithms
	- Lower bounds for parallel algorithms
		- must state number of PE and arch used along with comparisons, arithmetic ops
