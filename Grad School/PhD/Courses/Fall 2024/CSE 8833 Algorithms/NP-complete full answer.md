# How to prove that a problem is NP-complete?
- Prove that it is in the class NP
	- describe a nondeterministic polynomial algorithm for solving it
		- Nondeterministic step:
			- Guess the solution from a finite (but large) set of possibilities
				- know as a certificate or witness
		- Deterministic step:
			- verify that the cert is correct (or not) by running a polynomial time deterministic algo
- Prove that it is NP hard
	- from scratch
	- reduce it in polynomial time to the problem we want to show is NP-hard
		- if P is polynomial-time reducible to Q, then P is "no harder to solve" than Q
		- Using reductions:
			- if P is polynomial-time reducible to Q, we say $P \leq_{p} Q$ 
			- if P is NP-hard and $P \leq_{p} Q$, then Q is also NP-hard
			- if $Q \in NP$ and Q is NP-hard, then Q is NP-complete
