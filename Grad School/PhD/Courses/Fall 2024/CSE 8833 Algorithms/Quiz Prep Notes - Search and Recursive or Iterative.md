# Basics
Need to identify the basic operation for a given algorithm:

# Linear Search
- Search through an array, one element at a time
- Basic operation: comparison, search element to the list element
- Running times
	- Best case: $B(n) = 1$, in this case the first element is the desired element
	- Worst case: $W(n) = n$, here our desired element is the last element in our list
	- Average case: $A(n) = \frac{n + 1}{2}$ or $O(n)$ 

# Binary Search
- Split an array into 2
- Basic op: Comparison, search element to midpoint
- Running times:
	- $B(n) = 1$, found at midpoint
	- $W(n) = 2\lceil \log(n+1) \rceil$   
	- $A(n) = \lceil \frac{3n}{2} \rceil - 2$ 

# Quicksort


# Recursive Methods

# Iterative Methods
