## Models for Algorithmic Design
- different algorithms require different arch
- design a new algo for each arch
- Universal Abstract Model
	- can be ported to specific computers
	- written for the abstract
	- performance can be predicted ahead of time
	- requirements:
		- general enough to capture important properties of the class of parallel computers
		- execute efficiently on parallel computers
		- problem:
			- goals conflict
			- connectivity assumptions for linear arrays and meshes: low, for hypercubes: high
			- if you design for one (low) than you will have sub-optimal performance on the other (high in this case)
			- ultimately, can't build a model that satisfies both
			- No such model currently exists or is known
		- Today:
			- basic communication operations
			- only implementation of these ops must be optimized for different parallel computer
			- only a small set of communication ops
			- concurrency vs. locality
- Example:
	- Matrix multiplication
		- $A, B$ are $n \cdot n$ matrices, $n=4$
		- $C = AB$ where $C_{i,j} = \Sigma_{l=1}^n A(i, l)B(l, j)$ 
		- schedule ops by level
		- We use  $n$ processors to compute $C_{i,j}$
		- $C$ contains $n^2 C_{i,j}$ elements
		- Total processors: $n^2\cdot n = n^3$ 
			- executes in $O(\log n)$ time
