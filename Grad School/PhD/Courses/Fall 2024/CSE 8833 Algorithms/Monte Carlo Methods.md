## Monte Carlo Prediction
- learn the state value function of a given policy
- average the returns after visits to that state
	- more returns, converges to the expected value
### First-visit MC 
- analysis:
	- $O(n^2)$, maybe? Nested for-loop
	- Is converge quadratically the same as algorithmic complexity?
	- Can we find an equation for MC methods?
## Monte Carlo Estimation
- state-action pairs
### Monte Carlo ES
- analysis:
	- $O(n^2)$

## Monte Carlo Prediction
## Off-policy MC prediction
- analysis:
	- $O(n^2)$
