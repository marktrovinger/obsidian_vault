- Code rot was a big problem
	- Updated to newer packages
		- Gymnasium, Torch
	- Read through the code for dataset generation TODO
	- Fixed errors that have cropped up for updated packages
		- torch leaf 
		- tri_scale error
- Code was present for Rosenbrock, but no experiments were done
	- Did a Rosenbrock experiment in a similar way to the existing experiments
		- Worked, but the results produced didn't look like the others
