## o-notation
Little o is not the same as big O. 

## $\omega$-notation
This is used to denote a lower-bound that is not asympotitically tight. 

### Time Efficiency Non-Recursive
You first need to determine the input size for a given algorithm. 

### Recursive Algorithms
Using forward substitutions, a recurrence relation can be solved, given a set of initial conditions. Use mathematical induction to prove that a given recurrence relation has a time efficiency.
