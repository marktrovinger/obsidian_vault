## Monotonicity
Monotonically increasing refers to a state where $m\leq n$ implies that $f(m) \leq f(n)$, monotonically decreasing refers to the opposite. 

### Example 1.16
For any real constant $a \geq 0$, the polynomial function $f(n) = n^a$ is monotonically increasing, $3^a \leq 4^a$ for all $a \geq 0$. For any real constant $a \leq 0$ the same function is monotonically decreasing. 

## Floors and Ceilings
The floor is the greatest integer less than or equal to $x$, whereas the ceiling is least integer greater than or equal to $x$. 

### Example 1.18
$\lfloor 3.8 \rfloor = 3$ 
$\lfloor -3.8 \rfloor = -3$ 

We can also say the floor of $n/2$ added to the ceiling of the same equals $n$, $\lfloor n/2 \rfloor + \lceil n/2 \rceil = n$.

## Polynomials
Polynomials are asymptotically positive iff $a_d < 0$, and if we have a polynomial $p(n)$, NEED TO FINISH THIS SECTION
