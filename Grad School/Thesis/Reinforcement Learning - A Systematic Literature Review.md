## Overview
This paper is a literature review for the area of DRL, and was published on December 28, 2021. Because of the date of publication, there are a few advancements that have been missed, namely any work to use Transformers in RL. The paper lays out the basic theoretical underpinnings of RL, starting with the learning models in RL, MDPs and Q-Learning.

## Literature Review
The paper discusses previous literature reviews that have been conducted in the field of RL, with four papers mentioned. The first paper looked at how RL has been applied to healthcare, the second paper conducted a survey of RL algorithms and techniques, the third paper looked at the fundamentals of RL and examined some of the essential algorithms in RL, while also emphasizing the merits of NN-based approaches. The fourth paper looked at RL with an NLP lens, and concluded that NLP can be used for RL tasks.

## Methodology
The methodology used follows the guidelines laid out by Kitchenham, which is a paper I need to read. The inclusion critera for the paper was to include any paper that was relevant to the topic and not published before 2011. The three databases used in the search are IEEE Xplor, ACM, and Science Direct. I am curious as to why the ArXiv was not included.

### Research Questions
There are three research questions that presented, and developing these questions is a skill I need to work on. 

Question 1: What are the approaches/algorithms that are used for problem-solving in RL? 
Question 2: What are the widely used evaluation metrics for measuring the performance of the employed RL model?
Question 3: What are the merits and demerits of each study in RL?

### Query Strings
Once the research questions have been decided, the next step the author took was to develop database query strings. I am not going to reproduce these strings here, but knowing what they are might be useful in the future.

### Search Results
The search queries returned 46 papers in IEEE, 36 in ACM, and 55 in Science Direct, these numbers are raw numbers, and will change when a closer examination is done later. 

### Search Process
The paper states more explicity what the inclusion/exclusion criteria are, and also discusses that the abstract for each paper was read, and discarded if necessary. Once the search process was completed, there are a total of 46 papers that made the cut, with 18 from IEEE, 15 from ACM, and 13 from Science Direct. I find this result not surprising, as both IEEE and ACM are focused on  computing and Science Direct is more general.
