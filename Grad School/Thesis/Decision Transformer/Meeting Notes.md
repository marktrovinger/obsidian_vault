2/14:
Report notes:
- Generating data takes quite a bit of time, also outputs might be too large given the original image size, might want to look into that, maybe a coding session/sprint?
- Started work (hopefully not duplicating work already do) on integrating VizDoom into DT workflow, there are some methods which might be needed others maybe not
- My advisor might be MIA for a couple of weeks, not sure if that will affect anything
- Lets look at the paper that generated the datasets used by DT, I think reproducing those results might be a good idea
