# Week One: Introduction
Created: 2023-01-09 15:44
Papers will be referenced each week, so make sure to read and understand them before the week. The reason we study NLP is because most of the ways we interact with others involves natural language, and there are multiple different subdomains. My goal during the class should be to learn to develop new ways to approach NLP problems, and strengthen my ability to examine and analyze text. Also, improve algorithmic thinking and overall sense of accomplishment.

Homework turnin will consist of both code, `.py` files and a written report, which will be discussed later, when the first homework is assigned. The course will be a combination of both intro topics, through the textbook and SOTA results through research papers (yay! more oppourtunites to read papers). As always, start early on everything. Stopping by office hours on Thursday might be the best option, as I can attend while Julie is there, any day that Sara is home would work too.
