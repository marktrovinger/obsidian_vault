A great starting point for any machine learning project. Is a discriminative classifier, whereas naive Bayes is a generative classifier. The example of a discriminative classifier uses dogs and cats, and may not find the features that actually matter. 

Formula: $c = argmax\_{c \in C} P(c|d)$ 

Binary classification works the same way it does for more traditional machine learning.
