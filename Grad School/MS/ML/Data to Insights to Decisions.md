			- Situational fluency
				- Understand enough to communicate with stakeholders
				- Understand the quirks and nuances of the business

				- How using it will solve the original business problem
## Case Study 1
### Business Understanding
Motor insurance fraud detection
- Claim Prediction
	- How likely is a given claim to be fraudulent? Assign a score, and above a threshold triggers an investigation
- Member Prediction
	- How likely is a given member to commit fraudulent actions? Model could be run every quarter and action taken if a member's profile identifies a possibility of fraud. Actions taken can vary
- Application Prediction
	- How likely is it that an application will result in a fraudulent claim? Actions taken would be a denial of an application
- Payment Prediction
	- How likely is it that a requested amount is higher than the damages actually cost? While the company is paying less, time and resources need to be devoted
### Feasibility
Can we actually implement any of these ideas?
- Ask the following questions:
	- Do we have the data necessary to implement any of these ideas?
		- If not, we can't do it!
	- Can we use the solutions provided?
- Also consider: 
	- Key objects in data model, and availability
	- Connections between keys and data model
		- Can we connect the various data sources to collect necessary data for the analytics model?
	- Data granularity
		- We might have the necessary data, but is it in a granular enough form?
	- Volume of data
		- Both too big and too small are a problem
	- Time Horizon
		- Does data exist for the time period required?
#### Application: Motor Insurance Fraud
Using the questions above, lets apply those questions to the auto insurance case study.
- Claim Prediction
	- Data Reqs: a large amount of annotated data with relevant fields, such as target value, claimant info and details
	- Capacity Reqs: A mechanism for marking some claims as more important than others, could cause delays in claim processing
- Member Prediction
	- Data Reqs: similar to claim prediction, but would require all relevant info be tied to a single member
	- Capacity Reqs: can a system be run every quarter? Can the company even contact members if a problem arises, and is such contact legal?
- Application Prediction
	- Data Reqs: similar to above, but would also require application details are kept when they may not be, also data may need to stretch back decades
	- Capacity Reqs: application assessment and approval would need to be more tied than currently
- Payment Prediction
	- Data Reqs: all payment, policy, and claim details would need to be stored, including amount requested and amount actually paid
	- Capacity Reqs: Similar to member prediction, can this be done in a timely manner? Does there need to be a customer contact center?
#### ABT (Analytics Base Table)
- Data Preparation step of CRISP-DM
	- Overlaps with Business Understanding
	- Iterative process
- ABT
	- Basically a dataset
	- descriptive features
	- Target feature
	- Different data sources go into an ABT, then fed to the predictive model
	- What is the prediction subject?
		- Depends on the question asked, for claim and payment prediction, the subject is the claim
	  - Each row is one instance
		  - "one-row-per-subject"
			  - Example for auto insurance would be one row would be one claim or member, depending on the ABT
	- Domain concepts
		- Not an exhaustive list, the basic idea is an abstraction that describes something about the subject that a list of concrete features can be built from
		- Prediction subject details
		- Demographics
		- Usage
			- Frequency or recency, monetary value of customer interaction
		- Usage changes
			- Any change in usage, positive or negative
		- Special Usage
			- Anything considered special, could be contacting for a complaint
		- Lifecycle Phase
			- New, loyal or lapsed
		- Network Links
			- Connections between either customers or products
	- Knowledge elicitation
		- Asking people who know
### ABT Application: Auto Insurance
- ABT for the claim prediction
- Domain concepts for this instance are policy details
	- Subconcepts are a more fine grain version, subconcepts will lead to one or more descriptive features
- Designing and Implementing Features
	- Proxy features
		- When direct measurement isn't possible
	- Data Availability
		- Do we have data from time periods necessary?
	- Timing
		- Is the data available when we want to use the model?
	- Longevity
		- Will the data be stale when we need to use it?
			- Even if it is stale, we may be able to scale the data to extend usable lifespan
	- Iterative process
- Data Types
	- Numeric
	- Interval
		- allow ordering and subtraction, but not other operations
	- Textual
		- Short text, name/address
	- Ordinal
		- Ordering but not arithmetic
	- Categorical
		- finite set that cannot be ordered and no math
	- Binary
	- Usually reduces to continuous and categorical
		- Categorical has levels or domains
- Feature Types
	- Raw
		- Come directly from data sources
	- Derived
		- Values computed from raw sources
		- Aggregates
			- Count, sum, average, min/max
		- Flags
			- Binary, presence or absence of a characteristic
		- Ratios
			- Captures a relationship between two or more features
		- Mappings
			- Converts continuous to categorical
				- Example: salary from numeric to low, med, high
		- Others
			- Anything else, can be very creative
- Time
	- Propensity models
		- How likely an event is to occur
		- Observation period
			- Descriptive features are calculated
		- Outcome period
			- Target features are calculated
	- Next-best-offer-models
		- Descriptive features are time-dependent but the target feature is not
### Legal Issues
Several legal issues are necessary to know in order to build predictive models legally
- Anti-discrimination legislation
- Data protection legislation
	- Collection limitation principle
	- Purpose specification principle
	- Use limitation principle
### Implementing Features
- Data manipulation
	- Implemented in and performed by:
		- Database Management Systems
		- Data Management Tools
		- Data Manipulation Tools
- Extract-transform-load (ETL) process
