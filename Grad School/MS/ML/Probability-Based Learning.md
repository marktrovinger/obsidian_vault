- Product Rule
- Chain Rule
## Bayes' Theorem
- The probability that an event will occur is the probability of the evidence times the probability of the event itself
- Formal definition:
	- $P(X|Y) = \frac{P(Y|X)P(X)}{P(Y)}$ 
- Theorem of Total Probability
- Can be derived using the product rule
- Denominator acts a normalizer, keeping the value between 0 and 1
- Posterior probability distribution
- Generalized Bayes' Theorem
