- More descriptive features makes for a better model, but the law of diminishing returns does kick in
- Sampling Density
	- Average density of instances across a feature space
	- Measured by average density of unit hypercube
		- $density = k^{\frac{1}{m}}$, where $k$ is the number of instances, and $m$ is the number of dimensions
- Curse of dimensionality
	- More dimensions, lower density
- Feature Selection
	- Predictive
		- Useful for predicting the target value
	- Interacting
		- Not good on its own, but can be combined to create a useful feature
	- Redundant
		- High corr with another feature
	- Irrelevant
	- Strategies
		- Rank and Prune
			- Use of filters to remove irrelevant features
			- Information gain is a possible filter
			- Greedy local search
				- Generates a set of candidate feature subsets, and then selects from that set, according to a termination condition
		- Forward sequential selection
		- Backward sequential selection
