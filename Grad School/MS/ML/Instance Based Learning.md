- Similarity based learning
- Lazy evaluation, computations not done until needed
- Memorization, the predictions made come from the training data
- Similar input attributes -> similar output values

## $k$-Nearest Neighbors
- Uses a $k$ number of closest points to classify a new point
### Locally Weighted Learning
- Variation for regression

## Eager vs. Lazy Learners
Two different styles of using training data
- Eager use the training data to build a model, and then do not reference the training data
	- Also build a comprehensive model that applies to the entire input space
	- Tend to be faster, but might not generalize to unseen data 
- Lazy do not build a model until asked to make a prediction
	- Builds "local" models instead of a comprehensive model
	- Can be more accurate, but are computationally more expensive

## Similarity Measures
How close are two points?
- Common measures
	- Euclidean
	- Manhattan
- Feature Space
	- $n$-dimensional space 
	- Each instance is mapped, with each axes as a descriptive feature
- Similarity
	- Measure the distance between the two instances
		- Shorter distance, greater similarity
- Measures
	- Euclidean:
		- $\left( p,q\right)   = \sqrt {\sum _{i=1}^{n}  \left( q_{i}-p_{i}\right)^2 }$
	- Manhattan:
		- $\left(\sum_{i=1}^n |x_i-y_i|^p\right)^{1/p}$
	- Both are specific cases of the Minkowski distance:
		- $\left(\sum_{i=1}^n |x_i-y_i|^p\right)^{1/p}$
		- $p=1$, Manhattan, $p=2$ Euclidean
- Metrics
	- Function that returns the distance between two points, $a$ and $b$
	- Criteria:
		- Non-negative
		- identity
		- Symmetry
		- Triangular Inequality
	- Index doesn't meet the four criteria
## Nearest Neighbor Learner
Algorithm:
- Given: 
	- A set of training instances
	- Queries
- Training:
	- Store training instances
- Prediction:
	- Iterate across training data, looking for shortest distance
	- Make a prediction for the query instance equal to the value of  the target feature of the nearest neighbor
Voronoi Tessellation:
- Partitions the feature space
- Decide the region
- Decision Boundary
	- Line (boundary) between two regions of feature space
	- Generated by aggregating local models, and can create a global model
- Noise Sensitivity

## $k$-Nearest Neighbors
Selects a target label with a majority vote from the $k$-nearest neighbors to a query $q$
- Equation:
	- $\mathbb{M}_{k} (q) = \text{arg max}\sum_{i=1}^k\delta(t_i, l)$
	- $\delta(t_i, l)$ is the Kronecker delta
- $k$ tradeoffs
	- Too large, may not be as accurate
	- Too small, sensitive to noise
	- Perform experiments with different values
	- Or use weighted $k$ approach
