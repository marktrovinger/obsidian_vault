- We are in the Eval phase of CRISP-DM
- How good (or bad) is the model we built?
## Misclassification Rate & Holdout Set
- Test Set
	- Also known as a hold-out set, data the model has never seen before
	- No peeking, model!
	- Generalize, or how well does the model do on unseen data?
- Performance Measure
	- What metric are we using?
	- Misclassification Rate
		- Confusion Matrix
			- TP, FP, FN, TN
	- Accuracy
	- Precision
	- Recall
	- F1
