## Pre-Meeting
- Working on improving performance for the worst performing env, my way home, hypothesis is that the hyperparameters for DT should be different than what we have tried thus far
- Adding different (better) graphs, using the TensorBoard data and Matplotlib/Seaborn
- Adding a pseudo-code representation of how the data collection works
- Making sure that the various sections flow better, both within and from one section to another
- Making it clear that the research questions asked in the introduction chapter are answered in the results chapter
- Expand the results chapter to make it clearer what the results we have demonstrate
- I plan to have a completed first draft by our next meeting
- Any additional results can be added to an appendix
