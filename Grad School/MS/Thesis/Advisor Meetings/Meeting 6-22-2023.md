- Takeaways:
	- Getting project finished, determining when a project is "finished", main goal right now
	- Need more detailed feedback on writing both paper and thesis chapters
	- 
- Wins:
	- Data generation method using Sample Factory works really well
		- DQN methods were both slow and had poor performance
			- ~9 days to generate 1M records with middling performance
		- APPO was very fast and produced good results
			- ~1.5 hours to generate 100M, of which 1% was saved
			- Allows for saving trajectories at an arbitrary timestep, we are currently saving the final 1%, or expert-level data
			- Performed similary to paper results, even with a longer rollout (128)
	- Using SF as a wrapper for the Doom environment worked really well
		- Sanded off several of the sharp edges that are present in the base environment
		- Acts as an encoding layer for 
- Setbacks:
	- Previous:
		- Hardware/compute
			- Finding affordable compute resources was a challenge, ended up buying a used workstation, which worked great until drive failure
			- Desktop I had wasn't enough
	- Current:
		- Hardware:
			- Drive failure 2 weeks ago was a major setback
			- Working great now
		- Multi-discrete environments
			- Currently a limitation of the transformer
			- Can be a part of future work, or an expansion of the current work? 
- Paper progress:
	- As a proof of concept it works now
	- What is the threshold we need for publishing?
	- Venue:
		- IEEE Transactions on Games/Conference on Games
		- CoRL 2023*
		- RLDM
		- ICLR 
		- Etc.
			- Send Dr. H information about conferences
- Thesis progress:
	- Resources for translating paper to a thesis?
		- First write the thesis then write the paper
	- Overleaf project has been created, using the Purdue Thesis Template
	- I need to more assertive when it comes to working with co-author, so that I am getting the things done that I need to do
	- Email him the intro when it is finished - next week
