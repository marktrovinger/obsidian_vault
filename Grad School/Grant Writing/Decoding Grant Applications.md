# Goals
- Dissect guidelines
# Story Types
Client stories, donor stories, technical stories, funder also has a story

The organization also has a story, along with impact stories. 

Clues are in the guidelines, focusing on commmunity or indivduals? 

What is the goal of the funder, who is reviewing, and how are they evaluating?

# Finding Fit: What, Who, and Why
## Research Options:
Free options, but they take alot of time

Not free, takes time, but less

Time isn't free!

No two foundations are the same!

### Where to look
- Grant guidelines
- Website
- Socials
- Annual Reports
- 990s
- Who else are they funding?
- What else are they funding?
- Board ties (look at 990s)?

### Story Cues
- Words have meaning (look carefully)
- Which topic is given the most space
- Score or page limited (not sure what this means)
- Who does the reviewing or can you find?

## Example
Indiana Arts Commission
- Make sure eligibility guidelines are matched
- Timeline
- Guidelines
	- Include a rubric for grant applications
- Panel Information
	- You may be repeating yourself, that normal!
	- Don't refer to a previous statement (no "as previously mentioned")
	- They have videos of previous meetings
Second Example
- Names and affiliations of reviewers
- Glossary
- Don't assume everyone is reading the entire application
- Answer everything

## No Guidelines?
- Should have at least a 990
- Can you call them
- LOI
### 990
- Contact Person
- Purpose Statement
- Officers
- $ granted
- List of grantees
- Look at actual grants for geography

## Found a good fit, whats next?
- Start with a draft you write
- Tell a story
- Make every word count

## Make a shell (master document, I think):
- List everything
- Notes for formatting
- Reinforcing Language (hope is not a plan)
- Charts, Images, Color
- Binding
- Submission Instructions (Follow the instructions!)
### Making Every Word Count
- 10 Page narrative and points:
	- More points, more pages
- Make sure to actually answer the questions
### General Template
- Doesn't have to be super complex
- Organizational personality
- Elements:
	- Cover letter / contact info
	- Executive Summary
	- TOC
	- Background
		- Operational support vs. project grant
	- Project Description
	- Budget
	- Logic Model
	- Attachments - Photos in this case
# Budgets
- Have a good budget helps!
	- Be specific!
	- What are the items actually for?
		- Make sure miscellaneous is small!
	- Use the budget to help tell the story
		- Especially if page limited
		- Can include pictures, especially for niche equipment
- Foundation Relationships
	- Reporting can be informal and more frequent
	- Phone is your friend
	- Postcard from volunteer
	- Invitation to visit
## Virtuous Cycle
- Ask, thank, report, repeat!
- Diane Leonard for new grant writers

## Grant Software
- GrantWatch ($)
- Foundation Directory, Search (more $)
- Instrumental (middle $)
